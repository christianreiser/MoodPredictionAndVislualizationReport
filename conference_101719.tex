\section{Introduction}
We know that our environment and actions play a major role in our well-being, health, intellectual and athletic performance.
However, there is less certainty about how much our environment (e.g., weather, air quality, noise) or behavior (e.g., nutrition, exercise, meditation, sleep) influence our happiness, productivity, sport performance, or allergies.
Furthermore, on some days, we are surprised that we are less motivated, our athletic performance is poor, or the disease symptoms are more severe.

To understand ourselves better, we built a system that predicts a variable of interest like well-being from past behavior and environmental data.
The system explains the predictions by visualizing its reasoning. 

This paper focuses on daily subjective well-being and explores its associations with outdoor and indoor weather, sleep and exercise, body weight, nutrition, heart rate, screentime, and productivity.

\section{Related Work}
\section{How is well-being defined?}
Psychologists often refer to subjective well-being (SWB) as frequent positive affect, infrequent negative affect, and cognitive evaluations of what a person considers a good life \cite{tov_subjective_2013}.

such as being enthusiastic, energetic, confident, active, and alert, optimistic, happy, joyful, curious, excited, relaxed, grateful
such as being sad, lethargic, distressed, in pain, anxious, sick, pessimistic, angry
In their review of literature on affect Barsade and Gibson (2012) define positive affectivity as the tendency of individuals to be cheerful and to experience positive moods, such as pleasure or well-being across a variety of situations, as compared to individuals who tend to be low energy and melancholy.

This study aims to test the predictive power of behavioral and sensor-based variables such as heart rate, weather, and sleep regarding subjective well-being.
To gather well-being data, we built a mobile app that asks the user to rate the days' average subjective well-being at the end of the day. 

\subsection{How is well-being measured?}
Rating in the evening before sleep:
Taking all together, how satisfied or dissatisfied were you
today on a scale from one to nine?

This rating mechanism has downsides due to recency bias, leading to the greater importance of recent events and fading affect bias, where negative memories fade faster than positive ones (Skowronski, Walker, et al. 2014).
Asking for a rating multiple times per day would reduce these biases; however, we decided against it, as it requires more effort and thus is less sustainable over long periods. 



\section{Datasources}
The aim is to use non-intrusive, inexpensive sensors and services that are robust and easy to use over a few years. A list of all data sources and explanations can be found in the Appendix.


\section{Data Aggregation}
These data types' sampling rates vary between 5 minutes (e.g., heart rate) to ~ weekly (bodyweight and VO2Max).
The goal is the have a sampling rate of 24h.
In most cases, the sampling rate is >24h, and the data is aggregated in 24h intervals by taking the sum, fifth percentile, 95th percentile, and median.
We use the fifth and 95th percentile instead of the minimum and maximum since they are less noisy and more predictive.

\section{Imputation}
The sampling frequency of Bodyweight and VO2Max is usually <24h.
Since Bodyweight and VO2Max represent physical entities that change relatively slowly, we assume a linear change, allowing linear interpolation to achieve the 24h frequency.

\section{Data exploration}
\color{red}
TODO:\\
- distributions, \\
- outliers(sleep, energy burned), \\
- limited sensor range( co2, noise)\\
\color{black}

The app computes the Pearson correlation coefficient and p-Values between all attributes. Since comparing each attribute with every other, we correct the p-values according to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.
A correlation is significant for p < 0.05.
Users can visually explore the data via a plotted time series with a seven-day moving average and manually inspect the relationship between two variables through scatter plots.

\section{Time-series} 
\label{sec:time-series}

Since the dataset is a time series, we added all yesterday's values as features, including yesterday's well-being.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{partial_autocorrelation_025lags_Mood.png}
\caption[Partial autocorrelation]{Partial autocorrelation of subjective well-being. The first datapoint, which represents the subjective well-being of one day ago, is considerable. The points representing the partial autocorrelation of 3 and 4 days ago are barely significant.}
\label{fig:partial_auto_corr}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:partial_auto_corr} shows the partial autocorrelation of well-being. Note that the first value, which represents the well-being of one day ago, is considerable, while the partial autocorrelations of 2 to 4 days ago are barely significant.

\section{Train-evaluation-test-split}
Since there is a temporal dependency between observations, standard cross-validation, which assigns samples randomly to the train or test set, would lead to using some data from the future to forecast the past, which isn't possible in the real-life application. 

We use time-series-splits to avoid this fallacy. However, as only the last split uses all training data, many splits are very inefficient w.r.t. data use. Hence, we create only one split. Essentially, this is a simple train test split, where the training set contains old data points, and the test split the most recent ones.



\section{Prediction}
We predict well-being through multiple linear regression and a neural network. Both methods use normalized data, where each type has zero mean and unit variance.


\subsection{Multiple linear regression}
The estimation parameters for multiple linear regression (MLR) are computed via the train set while applying elastic-net regularization and sample-weighting.


\subsubsection{Regularization}
We use a combined L1 and L2 weight penalty called elastic net regularization with the formula 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta} \equiv \underset{\beta}{\operatorname{argmin}}\left(\|y-X \beta\|^{2}+\lambda\|\beta\|_{1}+(1-\lambda)\|\beta\|^{2}\right),
\end{equation}
with the L1 ratio $\lambda$.
Specifically, $\lambda=0$ is the ridge regularization and $\lambda=1$ is the ridge lasso regularization. We search for the optimal $\lambda$ via cross-validation.


\subsubsection{Sample-weighting}
We assume that the factors influencing a person's well-being change over time and use exponential sample-weight decay as shown in figure \ref{fig:sample-weight}.
The formula is $max(14.7498 - 13.2869 * (i + 30) ** 0.0101585, 0)$ which is exponential decay fitted to a value of 1 for today's datapoint and reaches zero after ~82 years. After 82 years the sample weight stays at 0 due to $max(x,0)$.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{RegressionSampleWeight.png}
\caption[Sample weight]{Exponential sample-weight decay discounting older data as it might be less useful to predict today's mood.}
\label{fig:sample-weight}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Test}
Finally, we predict well-being via the data of a previously unseen test set and calculate the prediction intervals.

\subsection{Neural Network}
The neural network has one fully connected hidden layer with 16 neurons followed by a Rectified Linear Unit. AdamW is the optimizer, which minimizes the mean squared error loss with a learning rate of 10e-4 and a weight decay of one. 
We searched for the best neural network architecture and hyper-parameters manually through cross-validation.

\section{Results}
Of 198 variables, 77 correlate significantly with well-being (see table \ref{tab:features} in the \ref{sec:Appendix}). Although, many of them are highly co-correlated. The principal component analysis shows in figure \ref{fig:pca} that there are only 25 components that explain more than 1\% of the variance. Examples of co-correlated variables are
\begin{itemize}
    \item all the fourfold aggregated variables (i.e., mean, median, fifth-, and 95th percentile)
    \item weather indoor and outdoor
    \item time in bed and time asleep
    \item walking minutes, heart points, exertion points
\end{itemize}

\caption{The principal component analysis shows that there are only 25 components that explain more than 1\% of the variance, indicating highly dependent features.}
\label{fig:pca}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

For prediction, we drop nutrition data, as there is only little available, reducing the number of variables to 184.

\subsection{Multiple linear regression}
Elastic-Net regularization with an L1-ration of $\lambda=1$ leads to the best prediction performance on our dataset. We interpret that feature shrinkage is more important for generalization than the reducing the L2 norm of the weights, due to the high correlation of features.

\begin{table}[]
\caption[]{Regression weights. All other features have a weight of zero.}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{Feature}       & \textbf{Regression Weight} \\

DistractingScreentime  & -0.009                    
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:reg}
\end{table}

Table \ref{tab:reg} shows all regression weights. Note that lasso regularization selected only nine features to predict well-being. 
The prediction interval is $\pm2.3$ on the scale from 1 to 9 and $\pm1.2$ on the normalized scale with unit variance.
