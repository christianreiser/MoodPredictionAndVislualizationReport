	abstract = {Major depression constitutes a serious challenge in personal and public health. Tens of millions of people each year suffer from depression and only a fraction receives adequate treatment. We explore the potential to use social media to detect and diagnose major depressive disorder in individuals. We first employ crowdsourcing to compile a set of Twitter users who report being diagnosed with clinical depression, based on a standard psychometric instrument. Through their social media postings over a year preceding the onset of depression, we measure behavioral attributes relating to social engagement, emotion, language and linguistic styles, ego network, and mentions of antidepressant medications. We leverage these behavioral cues, to build a statistical classifier that provides estimates of the risk of depression, before the reported onset. We find that social media contains useful signals for characterizing the onset of depression in individuals, as measured through decrease in social activity, raised negative affect, highly clustered egonetworks, heightened relational and medicinal concerns, and greater expression of religious involvement. We believe our findings and methods may be useful in developing tools for identifying the onset of major depression, for use by healthcare agencies; or on behalf of individuals, enabling those suffering from depression to be more proactive about their mental health.},

We train automated forecasting regression algorithms using Random Forests and compare their performance over two sets of data: “workers” consisting of 490 days of weekday data from 39 employees at a high-tech company in Japan and “students” consisting of 3,841 days of weekday data from 201 New England USA college students.

Overall the two groups reported comparable stress and mood scores, while employees reported slightly poorer health, and engaged in signiﬁcantly lower levels of physical activity as measured by accelerometers.

	abstract = {While accurately predicting mood and wellbeing could have a number of important clinical benefits, traditional machine learning (ML) methods frequently yield low performance in this domain. We posit that this is because a one-size-fits-all machine learning model is inherently ill-suited to predicting outcomes like mood and stress, which vary greatly due to individual differences. Therefore, we employ Multitask Learning (MTL) techniques to train personalized ML models which are customized to the needs of each individual, but still leverage data from across the population. Three formulations of MTL are compared: i) MTL deep neural networks, which share several hidden layers but have final layers unique to each task; ii) Multi-task Multi-Kernel learning, which feeds information across tasks through kernel weights on feature types; and iii) a Hierarchical Bayesian model in which tasks share a common Dirichlet Process prior. We offer the code for this work in open source. These techniques are investigated in the context of predicting future mood, stress, and health using data collected from surveys, wearable sensors, smartphone logs, and the weather. Empirical results demonstrate that using MTL to account for individual differences provides large performance improvements over traditional machine learning methods and provides personalized, actionable insights.},

	doi = {10.1109/BIGCOMP.2016.7425918},
	abstract = {Recently, many efforts have been spent on observing individual's psychological states through analyzing users' social activities on SNS. In this paper, we propose a novel method for identifying the users with depressive moods by analyzing their daily tweets for a long period of time. Then, for more accurately understand their tweets, we exploit all media types of tweets, i.e., images and emoticons as well as texts, thus develop a multimodal method for analyzing them. In the proposed method, three single-modal analyses are first performed for extract the hidden users' moods from text, emoticon, and images: a learning based text analysis, a word-based emoticon analysis, and a SVM based image classifier. Thereafter, the extracted moods from the respective analyses are integrated into a mood and again aggregated per a day, which allows for continuous monitoring of user's mood trends. To assess the validity of the proposed method, two types of experiments were performed: 1) the proposed multimodal analysis was tested with a number of tweets, and its performance was compared to SentiStrength; 2) it was applied to classify 45 users' mental states as depressive and non-depressive ones. Then, the results demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms the baseline, and it is effective in finding depressive moods for users.},

	abstract = {Mental health conditions remain under-diagnosed even in countries with common access to advanced medical care. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications towards the early detection and intervention of mental health disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is from daily smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) or protected attributes (e.g., race, gender). In this paper, we study behavioral markers or daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile behaviors from high-risk adolescent populations. Using computational models, we find that multimodal modeling of both text and app usage features is highly predictive of daily mood over each modality alone. Furthermore, we evaluate approaches that reliably obfuscate user identity while remaining predictive of daily mood. By combining multimodal representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward the performance-privacy frontier as compared to unimodal approaches.},

Recent trends involve fusion of multiple data modalities - audio, visual, and physiological - to classify emotional state. However, in practice, collection of physiological data `in the wild' is currently limited to heartbeat time series of the kind generated by affordable wearable heart monitors. Furthermore, real-world applications of emotion prediction often require some measure of uncertainty over model output, in order to inform downstream decision-making. We present here an end-to-end deep learning model for classifying emotional valence from unimodal heartbeat time series. We further propose a Bayesian framework for modelling uncertainty over these valence predictions, and describe a probabilistic procedure for choosing to accept or reject model output according to the intended application. We benchmarked our framework against two established datasets and achieved peak classification accuracy of 90\%. These results lay the foundation for applications of affective computing in real-world domains such as healthcare, where a high premium is placed on non-invasive collection of data, and predictive certainty.},

	abstract = {To accomplish forecasting of mood in real-world situations, affective computing systems need to collect and learn from multimodal data collected over weeks or months of daily use. Such systems are likely to encounter frequent data loss, e.g. when a phone loses location access, or when a sensor is recharging. Lost data can handicap classifiers trained with all modalities present in the data. This paper describes a new technique for handling missing multimodal data using a specialized denoising autoencoder: the Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE). Empirical results from over 200 participants and 5500 days of data demonstrate that the MMAE is able to predict the feature values from multiple missing modalities more accurately than reconstruction methods such as principal components analysis (PCA). We discuss several practical benefits of the MMAE's encoding and show that it can provide robust mood prediction even when up to three quarters of the data sources are lost.},
